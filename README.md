Like many of you I love video games. In fact, I enjoy them so much I started created my own. What started as a hobby (which in itself started with a bored friday afternoon in the 9. grade), has now become my profession. 
Of course this doesn't have to mean that I have to give up that hobby, so I continue developing new projects every now and then.
